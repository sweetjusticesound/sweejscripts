## 📜 Scripts

### 📝 Item & Track Renamer
`Renaming/Reaper Track and Item Renamer.lua`

Batch rename items and tracks with a GUI. Supports find/replace, prefixes, suffixes, character removal, and auto-numbering with live preview.

- Find & replace text (all, first, or last instance)
- Add prefixes and suffixes  
- Remove characters from start or end
- Add sequential numbers with separators and zero-padding
- Live preview and auto-refresh on selection change

Example: `Guitar.wav` → `SONG_Guitar_01`

Requires ReaImGui extension.

### 🎧 Media Explorer Spotting Scripts  
`Spotting/` folder

Replaces Soundminer's "Spot through DSP Rack" functionality. Preview audio files through FX and place processed versions onto your timeline.

**Two versions available:**

⚡ **"Only Bakes Time Selection"** - Trims to Media Explorer selection first, then processes. More efficient for short clips.

🎛️ **"Bakes Whole File"** - Processes entire file through FX, then trims to selection. Better when FX need full audio context (reverb, compression, etc).

Usage:
1. Preview files in Media Explorer (plays through FX track)
2. Position cursor at desired location
3. Select destination track
4. Run script

Setup:
- Create track named "Media Explorer Preview"
- Add FX to preview track
- Configure Media Explorer to play through preview track
